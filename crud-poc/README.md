2) navigate to `crud-poc` folder
3) and Run `npm install` in the terminal ðŸ˜„
4) After successfull installation Run `npm run server`
    a) your api will start running (server is up on http://localhost:8000/) 
    b) Database hosted on Elephantsql.
5) navigate to `crud-poc\client` folder

7) After successfull installation Run `npm run start` (server is up on http://localhost:3000/) 
                    OR
7) If both (client & server) package are istalled properly then Run `npm run start:serve` (will concurently run client and server)
